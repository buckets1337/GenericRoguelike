This is my first attempt at creating a roguelike in python.

The majority of the systems in this game I owe directly to the tutorials by
Jotaf on Roguebasin.  I couldn't have done it without his clear examples.

Written in Python 2.7.4

You must have Python 2.7.4 installed to your computer in order to play.  This
is freely available to download, just run a search for 'python'

	Movement:

	  / | \
	1   2   3
the number keys on the keypad each move you in the direction they lie in from
the key '5'

number pad 5 = wait a turn

the arrow keys also move you in their corresponding directions

Keyboard Commands:

i = inventory
c = character info
< = use stairs (go down a level)
