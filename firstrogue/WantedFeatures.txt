	need to increase number of room instersections when making map

	variable map size, with # of rooms and room intersections scalable with map size automatically

	doors placed in mapgen at room/hall connections, start shut

X	timer system (mainly so 'torches' can deplete, when torch is out, FOV is severely constrained)

	above torch system, with torches as items that spawn on map

X	hunger system, with a refillable hunger timer that if it hits zero, the player dies, and food spawns

	monsters with gear equipped

	monster drops(pre-placed items should be much more rare after this is implemented)

	'bag' items that open another inventory screen (will require a variable for # of slots, 
		should be written into inventory menu)

	encumberance (over max carry weight = can't move till item dropped)

X	monster ai - monsters tend to 'stack' when attacking, when they should flow around

X	monster ai - monsters should alert and update alert-movement whenever a player is in sight.

X	monster ai - alert system, with monsters traveling to location of an alert and then stopping

X	monster and player combat has a chance of generating sounds (monsters roar, player-generated sounds not indicated)

	LONGTERM: item and monster lists broken out into separate files for ease of editing

	LONGTERM: 'travel' menu allowing player to interact with 'town'.  Perhaps this is another map, perhaps it's just menus.
		When entering town from dungeon, start again at floor 1, maybe also level 1 (but with gear kept)

	LONGTERM: dynamically named and bonused items generated, similar to diablo
