---------------

X	stairs and items are no longer visible on map when outside FOV.  fix it

	objects under mouse no longer displaying name. fix it.

	equipped items move to top of list, when dequipped, move to bottom

	furniture for rooms - inc chests w/ loot

	critical chance as a non-displayed stat, boostable by items and agility

	level up upgrades - skills/bonuses

	level up upgrades - agility boosts crit chance, toughness boosts defense

	fov 'light' should have alpha fade towards edge

	circular rooms in dungeon gen

	potential spawns of 'squads' of monsters (small chance maybe once every other floor-ish, room is MUCH harder)

	potential spawns of named 'boss' monsters (very small chance, should only happen once every few dungeon floors, drop nice loot)

	monster ai - FOV for monsters

	Items and Equipment breaking

	Some sort of Item and Equipment repair mechanic (maybe item based?)

X	variable potion heal amount (healing is now random by default from all sources)

X	variable heal between levels

X	heal at level up

X	reorganized function order and headings for better code clarity

	need to increase number of room instersections when making map

	variable map size, with # of rooms and room intersections scalable with map size automatically

	doors placed in mapgen at room/hall connections, start shut, can be opened by monsters if they smell you 
		(but not at all before smell is implemented)

	timer system (mainly so 'torches' can deplete, when torch is out, FOV is severely constrained)

	above torch system, with torches as items that spawn on map

	monsters with gear equipped

	monster drops

	'bag' items that open another inventory screen (will require a variable for # of slots, 
		should be written into inventory menu)

	encumberance (over max carry weight = can't move till item dropped)

	monster ai - monsters tend to 'stack' when attacking, when they should flow around

	monster ai - scent system for chasing player outside FOV

	LONGTERM: item and monster lists broken out into separate files for ease of editing

	LONGTERM: 'travel' menu allowing player to interact with 'town'.  Perhaps this is another map, perhaps it's just menus.
		When entering town from dungeon, start again at floor 1, maybe also level 1 (but with gear kept)

	LONGTERM: dynamically named and bonused items generated, similar to diablo
